// features of c language- portability, syntax bases, case sensitive, structure oriented middle level, uses of pointer, platform dependent, compiler based, modularity, fast and efficient, powerful, simple.

//Applications of c- operating systems, embedded systems, GUI, new programming platforms, google, mozilla firefox, complier design, gaming animation.

//character set- uppercase alphabets, lowercase alphabets,digits, special symbols, white spaces

//token- smallest individual unit in a program/statement- identifiers, keywords,constants,variables, strings, operators, special characters

//identifiers- fundamental building blocks of a program, used to give names to variable, functions, constants and user derfined data.

//data type is the type of value a variable will have, it also deines memory space for a particulat variable in computer. Data types are broadly classified as: 
    //basic data types
        //int, char, float, double
    //derived data types
        //pointers, arrays, functions
    //user defined data types
        //structure, union, enumeration
        
//type modifiers-
    //signed represents positive and negative 
    //unsigned represents zero and positive numbers only
    //long and short reperesents range of integer number

//three major data types -

    // int age = 22;
    // float pi = 3.14;
    // char hashtag = '#';

//format specifers-
    //short int, signed int- %d or %i
    //long int - %ld
    //unsigned int - %u
    //float - %f or %g
    //double - %lf
    //Long double - %Lf
    //character - %c
    //string - %s

//constants - values that don't change (are fixed)
// Types of constants
//integer constants - 1,2,3,0,-3,-5
//floating point/real constants - 1.0,2.0,3.14,-3.53
//character constants - 'a','A','v','$','^'
//string constants

//Keywords- Reserved words that have special meaning to the compiler. There are 32 keywords in C.

//expressions- statements or instructions given to computer to perform dome operations, every expression stores some value that can be stored in a variable

// Comments - 
// single line comment - '//'
//Multi-line comments - '/*......*/'

//output - -"printf("......\n");"
// \n - newline
// outout for integers - printf("age is %d \n",age);
// output for real numbers - printf("value of pi is %f \n",pi)
//  output for charachter - printf("star looks like this %c \n",star)

// printf - library function already specified in C
//input - scanf("required format specifier",&age)

//Compilation - A computer program that transleates C code into machine code
